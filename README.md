# Design Patterns from Head First book

## Creational
## Structural
## Behavioral
- ### [Strategy](src/main/java/com/armana/behavioral/strategy/App.java)
> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- ### [Observer](src/main/java/com/armana/behavioral/observer/WeatherStation.java)
> Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
