- ### [Strategy](src/main/java/com/armana/behavioral/strategy/App.java)
> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
